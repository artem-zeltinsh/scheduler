# Scheduler
Application to submit booking requests for meetings in the meeting room.

## Constraints
* No part of a meeting may fall outside office hours.
* Meetings may not overlap.
* The booking submission system only allows one submission at a time, so submission times are guaranteed to be unique.
* Bookings must be processed in the chronological order in which they were submitted.
* The ordering of booking submissions in the supplied input is not guaranteed.
